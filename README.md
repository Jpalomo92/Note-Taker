  ## Description
  Note Taker is an application where a user can take notes and save them. This is a platform that makes it easy for the user to keep track of items, like to-do lists, quick reminders, or thoughts. 
  
  This application is built to connect the front and back end side using Express.js. From here, the application has been deployed using Heroku.

  A big challenge for me was understanding the routes being imported and tying in the different requests being called. These requests consist of GET, POST, and DELETE routes. 

  ## Installation
  To install this application locally through your terminal:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Jpalomo92/Note-Taker.git
  ```

  Run the following command below to install the necessary npm packages:

  Run the following command below to install the Unique Identifier library package - This will help assign and identify a note with a unique ID:

  ```
  npm i uuidv4
  ```

  After type in the following:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```

  You will see in your terminal the following link. Press the ctrl + click:

  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```




  ## Usage
  After installation you will then be brought to the Home page. 

  Click get started and you will be brought to the Notes page.

  From here you have the freedom to the add and remove notes. 

  Please be sure to include a Title for your note as well as some text in the text box below the Title.

  Once these two fields are filled out, two buttons will appear at the top right of the page to either save your note or clear out what you currently have typed. 

  Once you hit save the note will pop up on the left side of the application for you to view or delete.
